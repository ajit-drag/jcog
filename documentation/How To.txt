#JCOG-Documentation
Note : This is temporary documentation of JCOG-Java Cognalys Library !
Final and more explainatory Documentation will be available soon.

To use JCOG , following steps can be used :

1. Goto Cognalys website ie. https://www.cognalys.com
2. Register and Create an Web App on cognalys.
3. Get the App ID and AccessToken from there.
4. Now in your Java App, follow :

	import org.jcog.jcog;
	import org.json.JSONException;
	class verifyMobile{
	Jcog cog = new Jcog("Your_app_id", "your_access_token");//you can also set appId and accessToken via 
	//setAppID(String) & setAccessToken(String) methods of Jcog class.

	String getMissedCallStatus = cog.recieveOTP("your_mobile_number_including_country_code");
	//this is to recieve an otp in the form of missed call on the mobile number to be verified

	String otpVerificationStatus = cog.sendOtp("Complete_Missed_Call_Number");
	//to send the otp to the server for verification.

5. Both the methods recieveOtp(String) & sendOtp(String) return status from server in the form of String.
	Note that for verification both reciveOtp() and sendOtp() must be from same instance/object.
